`cd-short.sty` is a package of shortcuts for `{tikz-cd}`. For further information, see the documentation in `cd-short.pdf`. 

It's still kind of a work-in-progress, but I use it all the time nevertheless. 

It's unlikely anyone will ever read this. But if you have read this, actually decided to use `{cd-short}`, and found some issues with it (or have suggestions), please let me know by emailing me at `catli@uchicago.edu`.
